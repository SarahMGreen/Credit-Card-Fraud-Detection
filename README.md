# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Using machine learning algorithms to analyze which is more efficient in catching credit card fraud.

## Techniques Used
- Random Forest (my focus)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

## Datasets
- Credit Card Transactions Dataset
- Credit Card Fraud
- IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset
- Credit Card Fraud Detection
- All datasets are from Kaggle

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Excel (for basic data cleaning/comparison)

## Goal
To compare models based on:
- Accuracy
- Recall
- Precision
- F1 Score

## My Role
- Focused on Random Forest
- Evaluated model performance and visualized results
- Helped determine the most effective ML technique for fraud detection

## What I Learned
- Real-world data isn‚Äôt always clean or labeled clearly
- Random Forest was strong with imbalanced data
- Visualization helped explain complex results
- Fraud detection datasets are very imbalanced
